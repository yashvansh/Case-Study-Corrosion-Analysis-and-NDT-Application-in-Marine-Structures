# Case-Study-Corrosion-Analysis-and-NDT-Application-in-Marine-Structures
Corrosion Factors in Marine Environments: The study examines key factors such as salinity, dissolved oxygen, and temperature, which accelerate corrosion in marine settings. This aligns with identifying and understanding environmental impacts on material degradation, a crucial part of corrosion projects.

Types of Corrosion: It highlights types of corrosion commonly affecting marine structures, including uniform, pitting, galvanic, and stress corrosion cracking. Recognizing these types is essential for assessing risks and designing preventive measures.

Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Techniques: The study discusses using NDT methods (ultrasonic gauging, radiography, eddy current testing) for monitoring corrosion in marine structures. Including this in your project shows your practical knowledge of techniques for early corrosion detection.

Real-World Case Studies: Examples like the Silver Bridge collapse emphasize the risks of unchecked corrosion, supporting a project focus on preventive maintenance strategies and regulatory compliance in corrosion management.

Preventive Strategies: The study details preventive measures (cathodic protection, coating systems, and maintenance strategies) that protect structures from corrosion, aligning with developing and applying solutions to extend material lifespan in corrosive environmentsâ€‹
